// Return the factorial of the provided integer. If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

// For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

// Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.
